### Introduction

This repository explores various option pricing models used in finance to estimate the fair value of stock options.
Implemented Models

- Black-Scholes Model: The industry standard model for European options pricing under the assumption of constant volatility.
- Heston Model: A stochastic volatility model that captures volatility smile (where implied volatility changes with strike price).

### Dependencies
